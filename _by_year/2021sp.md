Judges, expect to spend approximately five minutes with each team, in order to give you time to see them all.  You will be assigned a set of projects to view specifically, but you can feel free to talk to more teams as time permits!  Teams, keep this in mind and keep your presentations crisp and to the point!

# CSE Spring Departmental Demo Day

We're thrilled to invite you to the eighth bi-annual Comp. Sci. &amp; Eng. Fall Demo Day. Student groups from several CSE capstone classes will be presenting the culmination of 3-months of effort, hard work, (metaphorical) blood, sweat (well... caffeine really), and tears (see above).
