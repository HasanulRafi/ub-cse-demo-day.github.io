# CSE Fall Departmental Demo Day

We're thrilled to invite you to the third anual Comp. Sci. & Eng. Fall Demo Day. Student groups from several CSE capstone classes will be presenting the culmination of 3-months of effort, hard work, (metaphorical) blood, sweat (well... caffein really), and tears (see above).
