  - title: Setup
    details: >
      Tables will be available for both sponsors (each sponsor will get a table) and demo participants (2 to a table).  Easels will be available for participants.  If you need power, please let us know!  If you have any other special requests, please contact ahunt@buffalo.edu to let me know, and we will do our best to accomodate you.  There is an hour reserved for setup - you can come at any time during that period to get organized, but please make sure you leave yourself enough time to be ready to go by 2PM, to give you the chance to network.
  - title: Networking
    details: >
      Before we open the atrium to students and the public, we’ll have some time reserved for the participants to come and chat with the sponsors and the judges.  Pizza will be there as well (A big thank you to our sponsors!), so that the participants and sponsors can have a chance to eat before demos begin!
  - title: Judging
    details: >
      During the demo, judges will circulate to the participants demo stations, and they will be rating each project on a specific set of criteria.  Judges, expect to spend approximately five minutes with each team, in order to give you time to see them all.  You will be assigned a set of projects to view specifically, but you can feel free to talk to more teams as time permits!  Teams, keep this in mind and keep your presentations crisp and to the point!
  - title: Breakdown and Tabulation
    details: >
      At 4:30, we’ll pack up and head into Davis 101 for the awards, which will start at approximately 5:15.  The winners will be notified by 5 so that they can prepare a short presentation.
  - title: Prizes
    details: >
      There will be prizes for the top teams selected by the judges. Each team will have a few minutes to present their projects (or a video) to the whole group. Good luck to everyone, and I can’t wait to see you all there!

# {{ page.title }}

We're thrilled to invite you to the eighth bi-annual Comp. Sci. &amp; Eng. Fall Demo Day. Student groups from several CSE capstone classes will be presenting the culmination of 3-months of effort, hard work, (metaphorical) blood, sweat (well... caffeine really), and tears (see above).
