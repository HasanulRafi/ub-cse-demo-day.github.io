      different algorithms to enable automatic glass crack detection and a sample
      iOS Application to implement the Algorithm. We apply the combination of two
      machine learning models and some image processing methods to detect the crack
      with an estimated confidence rate. <br><br>The Mobile Application has an option
      to upload the image of the car component having glass or take a live picture
      which is then fed to the first pretrained model to extract the glass from it
      and then the second model generates a confidence score for crack to be present.
