    description: 'Inspired by the little libraries surrounding UB, our team developed
      Bookworm. Bookworm is a social media web application created to connect those
      with a love of books. We wanted to create a way for people who share this love
      to interact, befriend, and connect with others in their communities to bring
      back the social aspect of reading. Users can use the features  in our application
      to search for libraries, create personalized reading lists, set up trades, customize
      posts with our unique ISBN embedding structure, and build connections with other
      users through our friending system. We hope that our application will help build
      a community of readers one book at a time. '
