  - description: Distributed systems simulator is a web application that lets users
      simulate distributed systems protocols interactively. The primary intent of
      the application is to help students who take up distributed system classes,
      understand and visualize its protocols. Distributed systems are hard to understand,
      the protocols deal with unreliable clocks, process pauses, partial failures
      involving many parameters. Our interactive simulator will help distributed systems
      enthusiasts visualize and understand the concepts more intuitively by letting
      the users play with node failure, and other factors involved with the specific
      protocol, which will help the users deepen their understanding.  <br><br>Distributed
      systems simulator includes Discrete event simulator API which has features of
      creating the computer nodes and network connecting these nodes, send message
      between these nodes, drop the message, turn the nodes off and on, simulation
      timers etc. Currently the application consists a Heartbeat protocol and a PUB-SUB
      protocol. This API will be helpful in creating any new protocol simulation.
      This application is developed in HTML, CSS and JS. The application runs in browser
      that supports javascript version ES6.

  - description: When performing calculations to make inferences based on sensory/input
      data, one of the most costly operations is transferring data between CPU and
      memory.  This is done in order for the CPU to complete some calculation, then
      propagate the resulting data back to memory. These transfers are debilitating
      to devices that must be energy-efficient due to their nature (drones, etc.),
      since energy is used for this transfer process. <br><br>To remedy this, models
      of memory hardware capable of in-memory processing have been developed to use
      within devices that must make decisions based on some algorithm or decision
      model. If a machine learning model is trained and its training weights are used
      within memory to perform the computation-transfer heavy operations, then rapid
      inferences can be made from input.<br><br>To improve upon the model used within
      the previous paper, two more models have been developed and tested. The MNIST

      of the medicine so that the user can easily identify it. User can either choose
      an existing medicine, or can add the medicine with their own images and audio.
      If they are not feeling good either with the UI or the medicine, they can chat
      with the administrator and get their problems resolved. The major role of the

  - description: SCoOL is a simple programming model designed to facilitate and accelerate
      the search space exploration phase of the optimization processes. Although the
      programming model is simple, SCoOL is written in C++, which is not! This project
      adds Python bindings to the SCoOL library, allowing users to define the optimization
      details with simple Python semantics while execution remains delegated to more
      rapid C++ code.<br><br>N/A

  - description: Dynamic Optimization of File Transfers | OneDataShare.org<br><br>OneDataShare
      is an open-source tool for fast and secure file transfer with support for most
      cloud storage services and protocols like Google Drive, Amazon S3, etc. It aims
      to remove the burden of managing end-to-end data transfers from the shoulders
      of users. The file transfer is optimized based on certain parameters that remain
      constant throughout. In this project, we change the optimization parameters
      of the transfer at runtime and improve the transfer rate. The parameters are
      fine tuned dynamically using a Bayes Optimizer. Further, we also collect and
      report the state of the network to allow the user to understand the bottlenecks
      in their network.

  - description: Developed a general-purpose runtime execution engine for SCoOL (a
      framework for scalable search space exploration and optimization) using HPX
      (a parallel runtime framework similar to MPI)<br><br>The runtime execution engine
      is implemented for a shared memory system. It takes advantage of framework features
      like HPX futures and HPX threads for asynchronous processing of workload. The
      solution also relies on phmap's implementation of flat hash set that is much
      more efficient than the unordered set. The executor strictly confirms to the
      BSP model enforced by the SCoOL framework

      Optimization) Library using OpenMP. This library helps in solving large scale
      optimization problems in shared memory cluster.<br><br>The runtime execution
      system is implemented for solving large scale optimization problems in shared
      memory systems. This uses task based parallel programming techniques and is
      built on Intel OpenMP API but can be extended to support other shared memory
      programming models. The executor is akin to the classic Bulk Synchronous Parallel
      (BSP) model.

  - description: The embedded control system will take into account the amount of
      transient light available and the external temperature to deduce if the blinds
      need to be drawn or not. <br><br>A typical household loses about 10% of its
      heat through its windows. In an industrial building, the amount of heat energy
      loss would be at least thrice the amount. To counteract this loss of heat energy,
      heater and air ventilation systems produce more heat. This energy inefficiency
      could be cut down sufficiently with smart blind control.

  - description: "GEP<br>Is a project based on interactive devices that seek to enhance\
      \ the creating, exploring and/or experience sound.<br>It is anchored on the\
      \ idea of \u2018Enactivism\u2019 which, simply put, states that perception is\
      \ constituted from the interactions between an entity and the environment. Both,\
      \ entities and environments, mutually influence each other in a constant changing\
      \ system. In this sense, GEP is aimed to enhance the experience of becoming\
      \ aware of the constantly changing relations we establish with our environment.<br>Thus\
      \ its potential to serve for artistic but also educational purposes as well.\
      \ Each of the devices act as an extension of the person interacting by reading\
      \ motions form the body or parts of the body. In turn, these readings will modify,\
      \ create or change the sounds from the environment where the actions are taking\
      \ place. Potentially speaking, this can entail learning processes that can go\
      \ from learning to use the devices to create them and code the program that\
      \ will ultimately define what each device will do.<br>The nature of the project\
      \ is of being Open Source. This means, that the devices themselves can be altered,\
      \ reshape, refactor, and so on. Therefore, they can be adapted for the needs\
      \ of specific individuals or communities. Because they are MIDI devices they\
      \ can be hooked up to any computer that is capable to run any MIDI compatible\
      \ software. This gives a wide range of possibilities from paid to free applications\
      \ available to download from the internet.<br>The project is based on the use\
      \ of open source hardware, essentially Arduino and clone types of microcontrollers.\
      \ This allows for affordable and accessible learning experiences. These microcontrollers\
      \ open the way to include coding and hardware design as part of an artistic\
      \ project as well as for educational curricula.<br><br>GEP Pedal (interactive\
      \ shoe)<br>Wearable devices that reacts to different foot motions. It is built\
      \ with 4 different sensors (light, pressure, accelerometer and distance). Each\
      \ of this sensors can be used separately or combined creating a diverse palette\
      \ of sound shaping effects. Given that it uses MIDI communication to the computer,\
      \ it can be assigned to any parameter that is MIDI compatible in the host application.<br>GEP\
      \ Tebukuro (interactive glove)<br>Similar to the shoe, a wearable device still\
      \ under development. It consists of flex sensors that read the motions from\
      \ three fingers, an accelerometer and a touch sensitive fader. As with the shoe,\
      \ these sensors can be combined or used separately. Also using MIDI protocol,\
      \ it can be connected to any application capable of reading MIDI messages.<br>GEP\
      \ Sensing Motion Module<br>A modular arrangement of sensors. Each module consists\
      \ of 6 distance sensors that work as three different units within the module.\
      \ Each of these unites give a unique MIDI message that can be assigned to different\
      \ variables. This sensing module was designed with two main purposes: a) as\
      \ a module for art productions including (but not limited to) dancers that can\
      \ modify the sounds from any sound sources (instruments, recordings, environmental\
      \ music, etc.), and b) for educational purposes. For the latter, it entails\
      \ a type of interaction that makes necessary to be aware of others and what\
      \ they are doing in terms to coordinate, collaborate and engage in a communal\
      \ bond. Within a classroom environment it can signify the breakdown<br>Matias\
      \ Homar<br>of barriers allowing the differences to arise in a positive and constructive\
      \ way. Each person involve can truly contribute with their uniqueness. And from\
      \ this divers universe of possibilities it can emerge a representative work\
      \ that is based in our shared humanity."
