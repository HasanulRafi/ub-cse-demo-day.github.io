  - description: Distributed systems simulator is a web application that lets users
      simulate distributed systems protocols interactively. The primary intent of
      the application is to help students who take up distributed system classes,
      understand and visualize its protocols. Distributed systems are hard to understand,
      the protocols deal with unreliable clocks, process pauses, partial failures
      involving many parameters. Our interactive simulator will help distributed systems
      enthusiasts visualize and understand the concepts more intuitively by letting
      the users play with node failure, and other factors involved with the specific
      protocol, which will help the users deepen their understanding.  <br><br>-

      is an open-source tool for fast and secure file transfer with support for most
      cloud storage services and protocols like Google Drive, Amazon S3, etc. It aims
      to remove the burden of managing end-to-end data transfers from the shoulders
      of users. The file transfer is optimized based on certain parameters that remain
      constant throughout. In this project, we change the optimization parameters
      of the transfer at runtime and improve the transfer rate. The parameters are
      fine tuned dynamically using a Bayes Optimizer. Further, we also collect and
      report the state of the network to allow the user to understand the bottlenecks
      in their network.

      \ that examines how oyster settlement patterns are impacted by anthropogenic\
      \ noise. The project focuses on the oyster reseeding initiatives in the waterways\
      \ of New York City\u2019s harbor \u2014 once the largest harvesting region for\
      \ oysters in the 1800\u2019s. Sound responsive robotic oysters created at different\
      \ stages of their life cycle (larvae, pediveliger, reproductive adult, etc)\
      \ will respond to sonic data collected from the harbor.<br>In this project,\
      \ we designed the actuation mechanism for a 3-D printed Oyster to open and close,\
      \ and a mechanism to spew water. The oyster sits in water, listens to ambient\
      \ sounds and spews water based on the degree of anthropogenic noise heard. Future\
      \ plans include developing a mechanism for the oyster to walk on the waterbed.<br><br>Joint\

  - description: "GEP<br>Is a project based on interactive devices that seek to enhance\
      \ the creating, exploring and/or experience sound.<br>It is anchored on the\
      \ idea of \u2018Enactivism\u2019 which, simply put, states that perception is\
      \ constituted from the interactions between an entity and the environment. Both,\
      \ entities and environments, mutually influence each other in a constant changing\
      \ system. In this sense, GEP is aimed to enhance the experience of becoming\
      \ aware of the constantly changing relations we establish with our environment.<br>Thus\
      \ its potential to serve for artistic but also educational purposes as well.\
      \ Each of the devices act as an extension of the person interacting by reading\
      \ motions form the body or parts of the body. In turn, these readings will modify,\
      \ create or change the sounds from the environment where the actions are taking\
      \ place. Potentially speaking, this can entail learning processes that can go\
      \ from learning to use the devices to create them and code the program that\
      \ will ultimately define what each device will do.<br>The nature of the project\
      \ is of being Open Source. This means, that the devices themselves can be altered,\
      \ reshape, refactor, and so on. Therefore, they can be adapted for the needs\
      \ of specific individuals or communities. Because they are MIDI devices they\
      \ can be hooked up to any computer that is capable to run any MIDI compatible\
      \ software. This gives a wide range of possibilities from paid to free applications\
      \ available to download from the internet.<br>The project is based on the use\
      \ of open source hardware, essentially Arduino and clone types of microcontrollers.\
      \ This allows for affordable and accessible learning experiences. These microcontrollers\
      \ open the way to include coding and hardware design as part of an artistic\
      \ project as well as for educational curricula.<br><br>GEP Pedal (interactive\
      \ shoe)<br>Wearable devices that reacts to different foot motions. It is built\
      \ with 4 different sensors (light, pressure, accelerometer and distance). Each\
      \ of this sensors can be used separately or combined creating a diverse palette\
      \ of sound shaping effects. Given that it uses MIDI communication to the computer,\
      \ it can be assigned to any parameter that is MIDI compatible in the host application.<br>GEP\
      \ Tebukuro (interactive glove)<br>Similar to the shoe, a wearable device still\
      \ under development. It consists of flex sensors that read the motions from\
      \ three fingers, an accelerometer and a touch sensitive fader. As with the shoe,\
      \ these sensors can be combined or used separately. Also using MIDI protocol,\
      \ it can be connected to any application capable of reading MIDI messages.<br>GEP\
      \ Sensing Motion Module<br>A modular arrangement of sensors. Each module consists\
      \ of 6 distance sensors that work as three different units within the module.\
      \ Each of these unites give a unique MIDI message that can be assigned to different\
      \ variables. This sensing module was designed with two main purposes: a) as\
      \ a module for art productions including (but not limited to) dancers that can\
      \ modify the sounds from any sound sources (instruments, recordings, environmental\
      \ music, etc.), and b) for educational purposes. For the latter, it entails\
      \ a type of interaction that makes necessary to be aware of others and what\
      \ they are doing in terms to coordinate, collaborate and engage in a communal\
      \ bond. Within a classroom environment it can signify the breakdown<br>Matias\
      \ Homar<br>of barriers allowing the differences to arise in a positive and constructive\
      \ way. Each person involve can truly contribute with their uniqueness. And from\
      \ this divers universe of possibilities it can emerge a representative work\
      \ that is based in our shared humanity."
