      title: French MWE and their sturctural differences in treebanks
      description: >
        In this study, I will explain what structural differences remain in French Treebanks after being converted to the ConLL-U format and what implications do these differences have. In particular, I will look at how Multi-Word expressions are encoded in these treebanks and what those differences mean in terms of dependency analysis. Finally I will present how unified treebanks could potentially be merged to increase the accuracy of automatic dependency parsing.

      title: IS DDI purely NLP?
      description: >
        Drugs play an important role in treating diseases which are innocuous to those which are extremely noxious. However, administering the right drug is pivotal to the revitalization of the patient?s health. Administering wrong combination of drugs has ramifications that can be harmless or can also be life threatening. Hence having a system that when, presented with two drugs, can notify whether the two drugs when given together can cause harm to the patient would certainly improve the quality of patient care. Going one step ahead the system could also predict the type of interaction that would indicate the severity of side effects caused. In this paper we would be leveraging machine learning techniques to create a model which will learn from the sentences that describe various kinds of drug drug interactions and would predict the type of interaction that would happen between the two drugs when administered together. Also along the way we would be answering the question of whether DDI is purely a NLP task or not with the help of multiple experiments. We would also be using domain knowledge for example the information pertaining to molecular structure of the drug to enhance the predicting capabilities of the model.

      title: Dependency Parsing with NULL elements
      description: >
        In linguistics, every element in a sentence plays a significant role. If there is an element missing in a sentence, we introduce a NULL element in that spot to represent that the sentence is not fully complete. This is done for better accuracy and understanding of the sentence. Hence, here we are performing dependency parsing with NULL elements. For this, we used the Penn treebank dataset. In Penn treebank dataset, there are a variety of null elements like *T*, NP*, 0, *U*, *?* etc. The null elements and their dependencies were understood from the dataset and they were introduced into the dependency tree structure without disturbing the dependencies of the elements that were already present in the tree structure.

      title: Intricacies of Dozat-Manning's Parsing Algorithm
      description: >
        This paper details non-projective dependency parsing algorithm described in \citet{dozat-manning:2017:ICLR}.  While it has been known for the graph-based parsing model using Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm \citep{edmonds:1967}, it uses a greedy algorithm.  This algorithm is more like based on Tarjan's algorithm for Strongly Connected Components \citep{tarjan:1972}. Dozat-Manning parser treats the probabilities of occurrence of word dependencies learned from training data as a directed graph. The underlying idea is to identify cycles in a graph using Tarjan's algorithm and then using a greedy approach of replacing edges from vertices in the cycle with next maximum edge until the cycle is broken.  Different from Chu-Liu-Edmonds, Dozat-Manning is not expanding or collapsing edges which result in cycle, rather outgoing edges from vertices in the cycle are chosen based on their weight and are used as a replacement until the cycle is broken. The dependency graph probabilities so generated are then used to deduce the parse output.

      title: Improving Machine Translation Results by Corpus Filtering for a Low-Resource Language
      description: >
        (submitted to ACL SRW 2019, under review)
        In this paper, we discuss the implementation of a method to reduce noise in a parallel corpus. A compositionality method based on cosine similarity as well as basic features to filter the corpus are used with a classifier to predict good sentence translation pairs within a parallel corpus. The purpose of this is to clean a noisy parallel corpus to the point that it can be used to accurately train a machine translation model.  The accuracy of our resulting machine translation models was quantified using a BLEU score, and we improved results progressively by our proposed method.

      title: Correlation between Fluency and Accuracy in Learner Corpus (submitted to ACL SRW 2019, under review)
      description: >
        Developing proficiency levels for non-native speakers has always been a difficult task. In this study, we explore the NUS learners corpus \citep{dahlmeier-ng-wu:2013:BEA8} and its annotated grammatical errors to automatically assign proficiency levels to individual participants by using fluency and accuracy of the learners' text. We determine the upper bound and lower bound of learners by using statistical measurement and classify learners into levels of accuracy and fluency. We conclude that perplexity for fluency is more correlate to accuracy compared to other fluency metrics in previous works. In addition, this perplexity fluency metric is more effective in predicting proficiency.

      title: Data Augmentation for Grammatical Error Correction
      description: >
        Neural machine translation (NMT) approaches have shown to be promising in grammatical error correction (GEC). However, the lack of high-quality training data in GEC is one major issue for NMT. The current study explores various ways of generating pseudo GEC data by focusing on real grammatical errors and their surrounding context. Fluency filtering based on language models is also incorporated to ensure the quality of artificial error generation.
