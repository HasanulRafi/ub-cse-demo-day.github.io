    description: Currently, in maritime industry the vessels need manual intervention

      to help with the docking but the cost of LIDARs are driving companies to explore
      cost-effective options which are at par with the performance of LIDAR.This project
      aims towards the design and development of a mechanism for depth perception
      using stereoscopic cameras as an alternative to LIDARs, for automated navigation
      of maritime vessels. The project will be delivered to the company, Buffalo Automation
      who will integrate it with their existing semi-automated methods to achieve
      a higher degree of automation.

  - title: Vector Map for Autonomous Vehicles
    description: HD Maps represent a set of features inherent to the road, such as
      lanes, stop lines, traffic lights, and intersections. We have created a vector
      map using Autoware Maptools plugin on the Unity Platform for a particular region
      of UB north campus. We have analysed the different ways/tools and open source
      formats available to create vector maps for localization.
