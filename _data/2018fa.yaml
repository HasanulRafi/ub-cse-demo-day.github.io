        Gamify is a framework to allow users to sign up to earn "badges/points" for playing games. The framework has two games namely Quiz and Scavenger Hunt.   These earned "badges/points" can be seen by others in the website that would allow users to compete with each other, and perhaps have a leader board to show who has the most "badges/points".  This will encourage youth visitors to explore new areas of the museum to amass "badges/points".

        Happiness is the scoreboard for life. Happiness now, happiness at the end of the day, happiness with life. There is no other word in the English language that is as rich, deep, meaningful in regard to how we view our lives than happiness. To be happy our life needs to “feel right.” Our life needs to be close to in balance physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. We are the experts of our own happiness. You control your happiness. You can build a happiness routine that sets you up for success in life and “A life well lived.” Leading research has determined that 50% of our happiness is genetic, 10% circumstantial and 40% is “our intentional activity.” In other words our beliefs, mindset and routines. We hope that this program will inspire and help you take ownership and action to enable your happiness. Rather than read hundreds of self-help books and listen to podcast after podcast we have boiled the advice down to a simple (minutes a day) program that you can start, today. Right Now. World happiness, healthiness and greater good starts with the individual – yes, you!!! Once you have built your personal happiness then you can start sharing it with others creating a virtual cycle of happiness. The happiness experiment is a program that has been designed to bring more happiness to your life through playful experimentation. We are going to load up your day with happiness. Help you build a happiness routine. Inspire you to push your happiness boundaries.

      description: >
        The project addresses the problem of real-time object detection in point clouds (LIDAR sensor data) in the context of autonomous driving. We have implemented an end to end object detector which detects the location and heading of the other cars with respect to self, this is crucial for the safety of the passengers, vehicle, and other vehicles on the street. The model can be easily adapted to detect pedestrians, cyclist, and other vehicular types given a dataset. The project is based on PIXOR detector and works at the speed > 10 frames per second.

        This product is aimed at developing a scheduling framework. The stakeholders are the professors who would like to schedule the TA’s recitation class timings for their courses. The primary focus is to implement a framework as a web application with the goal of scheduling the timings of TA’s recitation classes. With this product, the rules and constraints can be configured into the system and an interactive user interface will simplify the process of manual scheduling by dynamically guiding the user to set up the schedule without any conflicts. This product has been chosen to solve the long-standing problem of identifying and resolving the conflicts during manual scheduling."
